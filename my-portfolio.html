        <p>I began my studies the 16th of January 2023 and so far we've had two
        website-making assigments.
        My portfolio will, of course, be updated as
        more assigments has been made but feel free to check out what I've made
        so far.

    <p>The first assignment we were given, were to create an online portfolio for a character called Arne from a Danish satire Christmas TV-show ("Jul På Vesterbro"), and that it had to be mobile-friendly as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    The assigment came with some texts that we <b>had</b> to use and a picture of how the frontpage <b>had</b> to look. Otherwise, we were free to do whatever we wanted with the other pages and links, if we had time left before deadline.

    <p>The second assignment we were told to make a website about whatever we felt like, but it <b> had</b> to have two JavaScript-functions.
        <br>
        <br>
        I chose to make a website which sell cheaper FunkoPops and to include a tab- and modal function.
