            Gaming has always been a big passion of mine.
            <br />
            When I was little, it was the opportunity of living in a completely
            different world or fantasy land that intrigued me. One of the very
            first games I ever played (and actually remember) was Pac-Man. I
            must've been around 4 or 5 when my dad would place me on his lap and
            play it with me and I immediately associated "playing games" with
            something fun and safe.
            <br />
            <br />
            Not long after that, me and my sister got our very own PlayStation 1
            so we could play Spyro the Dragon. I could sit there for hours and
            have the most fun in the world and especially after <b>that</b> game
            I was hooked.
            <br />
            When I got older, the fun that came along with playing wasn't the
            only thing I appreciated. I started to noticed the importance of the
            art-work, the voice acting, the storyline and just all the little
            details that makes a game a great one.
            <br />
            <br />
            As of today, the consoles that I own (together with my boyfriend)
            are a PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Nintendo DS and a
            Nintendo Switch. And of course, a computer for gaming. My personal
            favorite consoles to play on must be a tie between the PlayStation 4
            and the Nintendo Switch. The PlayStation is perfect for more
            action-packed and long games where the Switch is more suitable for
            cozy little role-playing/arcade-like games, such as Pokémon, that
            you can just lay in the couch and relax with.
            <br />
            <br />
            My favorite games? I'm a sucker for story-based games with a
            beautiful and touching story and a bit of action - so games such as
            The Last of Us (Part 1 and 2), the God of War games, the Uncharted
            games, the Spider-Man games, The Witcher III, the Assassins Creed
            games and Red Dead Redemption II are some of my absolute favorite games.
            <br />
            <br />
            I like to be able to have a place where I can express my excitement,
            appreciation or love for anything game-related and that's why I
            created an Instagram-account just for gaming-related posts. If you'd
            like to check it out, just click on the picture to the right.
