Another big passion of mine is singing.
<br>
For as long as I can remember I have always loved listening to music and singing along to it.
The really fun part, for me, was to try and imitate the singers voices; how they cracked
their voices at certain times, their vibrato or how "thick or thin" their voices were and
I found out that I had a lot of fun with it and just singing in general - and so I began to
practice at home, a lot. 
<br>
<br>
July 2013 I finally felt confident enough with my singing-voice to create a YouTube-channel
where I could upload some covers of primarily Disney songs. Those songs were the ones where
I could "show off" my imitations in different singing-techniques the most, because those
songs were a good mix of both singing and acting. I slowly started to get comments from people
and they were all so sweet and encouraging and they boosted my confidence so much that I began 
uploading covers where I didn't try to imitate anyone and just used my own voice.
<br>
<br>
Though I still love singing and making covers, I haven't really made anything new in a few years.
But even though, it's still a huge passion and love of mine so I decided that, afterall, it still deserves a spot on my website.
