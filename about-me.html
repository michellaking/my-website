            My name is Mie, my pronounce are she/her, I'm 26 years old (born 8th
            of May, 1996) and I live in Copenhagen, Denmark.

            I started out wanting to make a website because of watching my
            boyfriend work. Maybe I should elaborate a bit on that?
            <br />
            My boyfriend works as a software-engineer and being the "curious
            George" as I am, I sometimes wanted to see what he actually did
            while working. A little by little it started to interest me and I
            asked him if he could help me learn how to code and luckily, he said
            yes. After that I was able to see just how fun and versitale coding
            could be and I only wanted to learn more.

            I have always had an interest in digital design and what makes a
            website, a picture, a logo and such things pleasant to look at and I
            wanted to see if there was an education that possibly combined all
            these things. And after a bit of searching I stumbled across an
            education called "Digital Media" and after reading a lot about what
            it could offer me, I decided to apply to the Digital Media-education
            in Roskilde.
            <br />
            <br />
            What I really like about the education is that you learn a little
            about everything - coding, animation, graphic design etc, so it's
            perfect for someone like me who likes a bit of everything and not
            <b>just</b> the coding.
